# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We plan to meet twice a week (wednesday and sunday in person) for an hour and half. We can also meet digitally through discord. Discord also allows for voice call and video call which we plan to use to meet online. Each member will take turns taking notes for each meeting as well through google docs.
2. **Assistance** 
If a teammate needs to get in contact with some other member they will have their phone number as well as ping them through discord. Each member is expected to reply within a reasonable amount of time such as an hour or so.
3. **Respect** 
In order to have a respectful environment that cultivates new ideas we plan to use a couple strategies. First, we will make to schedule regular meetings so that any new ideas don't go unheard. As a team we will also agree on some ground rules such as speaking once at a time, attending meetings on time, etc. Most importantly, we will encourage respectful discourse which will allow us to develop and improve upon ideas. For the final project we have all agreed to find an idea and we will vote on each member's idea based on how viable it within the time frame and how interesting or creative the idea is.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
As far as assigning workload we will create a gantt chart that keep track of the timeline of the project as well as each of our responsibilities. We will have some work that each of us are assigned that we will be reporting during our bi-weekly meetings. Whenever a member is struggling or encountering a challenge other members we will collaborate together to resolve the problem.
5. **Time Commitment** 
As long as each member finishes the task they are assigned it doesn't matter how long they take. However, 4-5 hours of work a week is expected from each team member in general. Eventhough each of the members have their own commitments outside of the project we have all unanimously agreed on a time that works for each of us. If new conflicts do arise we will set up a meeting to discuss the issues and resolve the matter. We will all remain respectful and tolerant throughout the process regardless of whatever conflict does come up.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
Whenever a conflict does arise we will make sure to address it respectfully. Some general strategies we plan to use include but are not limited to are spotting early signs of conflict so that we take a preventive based approach rather than trying to resolve it once it become a huge issue. For instance, if a member is habitually late, it is important to identify that early on so that they don't make a habit out of it. It is also vital that we don't take sides and make a member feel secluded or cornered. We will also agree on some form of consequence if a member repeatedely violates the trust of the group.
